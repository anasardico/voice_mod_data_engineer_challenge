Voicemod Data Engineer Questions

The first Question is a hands-on with some scripts and a scheduler. The tools used are not a constraint.

The second Question is a theoretical one with no correct answers so reply with what you think is the best solution for that use case.


For all the text based answers/ diagrams, you can use a text-editor or send it as a PDF document.
The code should be commented and reproducible with minor tweaks in a local environment. 

Good luck! :)
