This document serves to explain my pratical solution of the first part of the challenge.

etl_voice_mod :

Inside the ETL proccess for the tsv you gave me, I did 3 different forms of ETL. 
1st one I used the pandas library. 2nd onde I used the COPY statment and finally I pure python.

In all of them I created a simple check to see if is the first time the data is insert, or not. 
This prevents duplicates. And, if new data arrive, make sure that is inserted.
I put some prints so you can see what is happening. 

aggr_to_no_sql_db :

This is the script that will aggregate and run daily.
I did a logic to check data inside MongoDB to understand if something is there and if is the same that we have from the current select.
One improvment could be deal with the first time data is inserted. That part of the code, will run only one time in prodution.
If insert manually that first time statment would not be necessary.
